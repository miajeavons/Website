            <h2>User Interface / User Experience Design Principles
            </h2>
            <p>User interface design is way more than a design process, it is the products and intention of navigating the consumer on a journey. It has to be seamless, effective, and efficient. It considers every detail, from color schemes and typography to button placement and navigation flow, to ensure the design feels natural and engaging. Ultimately, great UI design enhances usability and creates a positive, memorable experience for users.

            <p>ZenVibe is a company idea created by me. This idea is an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience that combines guided meditation, full-body awareness, and sensory feedback to promote mental and physical well-being. Using VR, motion sensors, and haptic feedback technology, it allows users to enter a calming, interactive world where they can engage in full-body meditative practices designed to enhance mindfulness, reduce stress, and improve physical relaxation.

                The game focuses on the synergy between mind and body, offering players a transformative, full-body meditation experience that goes beyond traditional sitting meditation, integrating movement, breath, and sensory stimuli.
                
                Above is a user interface design of the game before it begins, this is a sleek, minimal design that allows players to start their meditation experience as efficiently as possible.
